sql_query_generation_prompt = """
Generate five complex SQL queries for a Snowflake database table named STOCK_DATA to create visually engaging and insightful line charts. The table has two columns: DATA_DATE (DATE) and VALUE (FLOAT), which contain S&P 500 data over the last 10 years.
 
### Requirements
 
1. **Advanced Time-Series Techniques**: Utilize techniques like Moving Averages, Lead/Lag Analysis, Year-over-Year Growth Trends, Rolling Aggregations, and Volatility Analysis (Standard Deviation over Time).
2. **Trend Analysis Graphs**: Use the above techniques to analyze trends.
3. **Title and Description**: Each query should have a short, catchy title and a description explaining the logic behind the query.
 
# Output Format
 
The output should be a JSON array with five objects, each containing the following keys:
- **Title**: A short, catchy name for the visualization.
- **SQL**: The corresponding Snowflake SQL query.
- **Description**: A small explanation of the logic behind the query.
 
# Examples
 
- **Example 1: Calculating a 30-Day Moving Average Trend**
 
  ```json
  {
    "title": "30-Day Moving Average Trend",
    "description": "Calculates the 30-day moving average of S&P 500 values to smooth out short-term fluctuations.",
    "SQL": "SELECT DATA_DATE, AVG(VALUE) OVER (ORDER BY DATA_DATE ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS MOVING_AVG FROM STOCK_DATA"
  }
  ```
 
- **Example 2: Yearly Performance Comparison**
 
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Yearly Performance Comparison",
    "description": "Compares the S&P 500 value at the same date each year to analyze growth trends.",
    "SQL": "SELECT DATA_DATE, VALUE, LAG(VALUE, 365) OVER (ORDER BY DATA_DATE) AS PREV_YEAR_VALUE, (VALUE - LAG(VALUE, 365) OVER (ORDER BY DATA_DATE)) / LAG(VALUE, 365) OVER (ORDER BY DATA_DATE) * 100 AS YOY_GROWTH FROM STOCK_DATA"
  }
  ```
 
# Notes
 
- Ensure all syntax aligns with Snowflake SQL standards.
- Consider real-life business use cases for the queries.
- Include a mixture of aggregate functions and analytical operations.

python_code_generation_prompt = """
You are a code generator specializing in data visualization using Plotly. Your task is to generate Python code that reads a given DataFrame (first 5 rows will be provided) and creates an appropriate Plotly visualization. Follow these rules:

## Start with these imports:
```python
import subprocess

# Ensure Kaleido is installed
subprocess.run(["pip", "install", "kaleido"], check=True)

import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd
import io
import base64
```

## Read Data:
Always read from `'/home/user/sandbox/data.csv'`, ensuring proper parsing of any date columns. If there are columns with date data, include them in the `parse_dates` parameter while reading the CSV.

## Detect Columns:
Identify the relevant columns based on the input sample and title.

## Choose Plot Type:
- Use `px.line()` for time series data.
- Use `px.bar()` for categorical/quarterly data.

## Title:
Use the given title in the chart.

## Multiple Series:
If multiple numeric columns exist, plot them together for comparison.

## Grouping:
If `YEAR` and `QUARTER` are present, concatenate them into a new `YEAR_QUARTER` column and use it for the x-axis.

## Ensure the following lines appear at the end of the code without modification:
```python
# NEVER CHANGE THE BELOW LINES OF CODE
img_bytes = io.BytesIO()
fig.write_image(img_bytes, format="png")  # Requires kaleido
img_base64 = base64.b64encode(img_bytes.getvalue()).decode("utf-8")
img_base64
```

## Output Format:
The generated code must be wrapped inside a JSON object under the key `"code_to_run"`:
```json
{
    "code_to_run": "<generated python code here>"
}
```
